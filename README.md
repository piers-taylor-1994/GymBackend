# GymBackend
## Highlights
- REST API developed in C# .NET 8
- JWT access tokens used for secure authentication
- Dapper ORM
## Swagger
The Gym Backend integrated with Swagger for ease-of-testing.
The API is split up into 4 groupings of endpoints that the Gym Frontend calls on demand.

### Authorization for Swagger
- To use most of the API endpoints, you firstly have to login as an authenticated user.
- Users are authenticated with a JWT access token. This not only proves that the user has the right authorisation to call the endpoints, but also provides vital information that's used by the frontend.
- This token can be generated by the "/auth/login" endpoint found further down the webpage.

### Auth
- In the auth grouping of endpoints, we find ways to generate access tokens and generate/hash passwords for user creation.

### Booking
- One request by my friends of family is integrating endpoints from gyms they go to for the purpose of booking various classes.
- These endpoints show the current timetable for the logged in user, as well as allowing them to book their class. This cuts out the neccessity to do it through their gym apps and enables them to do everything through this app's interface

### Patch
- To keep users updated of app changes/tweaks, I created patch endpoints to return/update the current patch the user is in, so provide patch-notes depending on which patch they're on at the time

### Workouts
- The workouts grouping provides the core functionality of my gym app
- Users are able to create/fetch routines, get workouts history, look at user workouts leaderboard information, create/fetch workout templates and provide useful information about their/other users workouts stats

## Live setup
- To enable interconnectivity, the live version of this backend is setup and hosted on Microsoft Azure
- I've setup the YAML files of this repository to automatically redeploy latest code to the web app when a pull request is completed to Main
